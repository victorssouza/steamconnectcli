## What is it?

This repo contains a python’s library and CLI to connect with your steam’s account and very shortly downloading your steam games with it!

## How far is it?

This app is still under development and can contain several bugs! :(  

## Requirements
* Python 3
* pip3 requirements

## Getting started
0) [Optional]: Create a virtual environment for Python3 if you are just testing the app, no need to mess with your own system  
1) Install python’s modules as a requirement using the following syntax: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

** Testing with CLI **  
2) `python3 CLI/steam_connect_cli.py`

## How safe is it?

This app will not persist your password in any circunstances, but you have to be aware that the future requests made will be based on a local cookie, which will work only in your machine. :]
